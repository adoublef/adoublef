# Welcome to all things _ORGANISATION_ 👋🏿👨🏿‍💻

This [Organisation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations) has been setup as a way for me to both keep all material related to related material in one place but also have greater exposure to GitHub features.

Once you have had a look through this profile, you can head to my [main profile](https://com.github.com/topheruk) where I have details on various repositories, organisations & gists
