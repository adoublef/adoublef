## Skills

### *Programming languages*

- [Golang](https://go.dev/) is a programming language I find myself gravitating to most. Starting in 2020, I have found joy using Go to design web services. A full look at these projects can be found [here](https://github.com/hyphengolang) 
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is likely my second most used language. I enjoy diving into reactivity frameworks such as [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), or web standards such as the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API). A full look at these projects can be found [here](https://github.com/hyphenode)

## Blog

During my spare time, I am an avid learner, constantly seeking new knowledge and insights. I frequently encounter requests from others to share my discoveries, which led me to create my [Medium profile](https://medium.com/@kristopherab). Here, you can delve into my thought process and explore the various ways in which I digest and process information.
