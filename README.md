## Skills

Feel free to explore these repositories to get a better understanding of my diverse coding experience. I'm always eager to collaborate on interesting projects and expand my knowledge in the ever-evolving world of software development. Let's build something amazing together!

### *Programming languages*

- **Golang**: Since 2020, I've been drawn to the elegance and scalability of Go when designing web services. I find immense joy in crafting efficient and robust solutions using this language. Feel free to check out my Go projects [here](https://github.com/hyphengolang).

- **TypeScript**: As my second most used language, I've been working with TypeScript since 2018. I love diving into reactivity frameworks like [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), as well as exploring web standards such as the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API). You can find my TypeScript projects [here](https://github.com/hyphenode).

In addition to these, I've also worked on exciting projects using other languages such as Python, Rust, C, and Haskell. Here are some repositories dedicated to each of these languages:

- [Python](https://github.com/hyphenpython)
- [Rust](https://github.com/hyphenrust)
- [C](https://github.com/hyphenclang)
- [Haskell](https://github.com/hyphenhaskell)

## Blog

During my spare time, I am an avid learner, constantly seeking new knowledge and insights. I frequently encounter requests from others to share my discoveries, which led me to create my [Medium profile](https://medium.com/@kristopherab). Here, you can delve into my thought process and explore the various ways in which I digest and process information.
